Git has rules that it uses to determine what the code should look like after the merge. However, there are some instances where git canâ€™t automatically figure this out using its rules, so it needs you to manually tell it what the code should look like after the merge. This is called a Merge Conflict. 

looks like: 

<<<<<<<< branch_name
 # Code from the branch_name Branch
========
# Code from the main Branch
>>>>>>>> main
